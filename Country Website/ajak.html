	<p>Azad Jammu and Kashmir (Urdu: آزاد جموں و کشمیر‎, romanized: āzād jammū̃ ō kaśmīr, transl. 'Free Jammu and Kashmir'),[7] abbreviated as AJK and colloquially referred to as simply Azad Kashmir, is a region administered by Pakistan as a nominally self-governing jurisdiction,[1] and constituting the western portion of the larger Kashmir region which has been the subject of a dispute between India and Pakistan since 1947.[8] The territory shares a border to the north with Gilgit-Baltistan, together with which it is referred to by the United Nations and other international organizations as "Pakistani-administered Kashmir".[note 1] Azad Kashmir is one-sixth the size of Gilgit-Baltistan and constitutes part of what is Kashmir proper—a valley divided between Indian and Pakistani control in which the majority of the ethnic Kashmiri population lives.[13] Azad Kashmir also shares borders with the Pakistani provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the south and west, respectively. On the eastern side, Azad Jammu and Kashmir is separated from the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir (part of Indian-administered Kashmir) by the Line of Control (LoC), which serves as the de facto border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir. The administrative territory of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (excluding Gilgit-Baltistan) covers a total area of 13,297 km2 (5,134 sq mi), and has a total population of 4,045,366 as per the 2017 national census.</p>
	<p>The territory has a parliamentary form of government modelled after the British Westminster system, with its capital located at Muzaffarabad. The President of AJK is the constitutional head of state, while the Prime Minister, supported by a Council of Ministers, is the chief executive. The unicameral Azad Kashmir Legislative Assembly elects both the Prime Minister and President. The territory has its own Supreme Court and a High Court, while the Government of Pakistan's Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan serves as a link between itself and Azad Jammu and Kashmir's government, although the autonomous territory is not represented in the Parliament of Pakistan.</p>

    <p>Islamabad Capital Territory (Urdu: وفاقی دارالحکومت‎) is the only federal territory of Pakistan. Located in north-central Pakistan between the provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, it includes the country's federal capital Islamabad. The territory is represented in the National Assembly constituencies NA-52, NA-53 and NA-54.[3]</p>
    <p>In 1960, land was transferred from Rawalpindi District of Punjab province to establish Pakistan's new capital. According to the 1960s master plan, the Capital Territory included Rawalpindi, and was to be composed of the following parts:[4]

        Rawalpindi, 259 square kilometres (100 sq mi)
        Islamabad, 220.15 square kilometres (85.00 sq mi)
        Margalla Hills, 220.15 square kilometres (85.00 sq mi)
        Islamabad rural, 446.20 square kilometres (172.28 sq mi)
        However, Rawalpindi was eventually excluded from the Islamabad master plan in the 1980s.[4]</p>

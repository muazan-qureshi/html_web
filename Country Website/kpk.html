    <P>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (often abbreviated KP or KPK) (Pashto: خیبر پښتونخوا‎ ; Urdu: خیبر پختونخوا‎),[1] formerly known as the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) (Urdu: صوبہ سرحد‎), is one of the four provinces of Pakistan, located in the northwestern region of the country along the International border with Afghanistan.</P>
    <p>It was previously known as the North-West Frontier Province until 2010 when the name was changed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by the 18th Amendment to Pakistan's Constitution and is known colloquially by various other names. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the third-largest province of Pakistan by the size of both population and economy, though it is geographically the smallest of four.[5] Within Pakistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shares a border with Punjab, Balochistan, Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad. It is home to 17.9% of Pakistan's total population, with the majority of the province's inhabitants being Pashtuns and Hindko speakers.</p>
